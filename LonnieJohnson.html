         <p>In an early blues field that boasts of a number of innovative guitarists, 
	Lonnie Johnson was without peer. With an unmatched sense of melody, 
	Johnson was equally capable of knocking out both dirty blues and fluid jazz phrasings
	He invented the practice of combining rhythmic passages and solo leads within a single song. 
	Johnson grew up in New Orleans, and his talent was infused with the city's rich 
	musical heritage, but after the flu epidemic of 1918 he moved to St. Louis.
	Signing with Okeh Records in 1925, Johnson recorded an estimated 130 songs 
	over the next seven years. During this period, Johnson recorded with the Duke Ellington 
	Orchestra and Louis Armstrong's Hot Five. After the Depression, Johnson landed in Chicago, 
	recording for Bluebird Records and King Records. Although he scored few chart hits of his own, Johnson's 
	songs and playing style influenced both blues legend Robert Johnson and 
	jazz great Charlie Christian, and Johnson's songs were recorded by Elvis Presley and 
	Jerry Lee Lewis.
