         <p> The Mississippi Delta is generally considered to be the birthplace of the 
blues, with the new musical form emerging around the turn of the 19th
century. But the story of the blues dates back before the Civil War and 
to the West coast of Africa where countless men, women and children 
were 
captured by slave traders and shipped across the Atlantic for forced 
labor on Southern plantations. 

Slaves from many African countries carried the songs and music of their 
respective homelands to America. There, amidst the hard work, 
fear and 
oppression, the slaves found a temporary escape in music and expressed 
both hope and despair in their songs. The musical traditions of numerous 
African cultures blended as the slaves worked side by side in 
the steamy fields of the south. Field hollers and work songs were a 
means of 
expression and communication ; which were often 
not otherwise allowed by the plantation overseers. With few instruments
 and little or no money, 
the slaves used their own voices and clapped 
percussion as musical tools. Their original methods of creating music 
became significant elements in 
the creation of the raw Delta Blues 
style. 
With its history of slavery, racial oppression and Jim Crow laws, plus baking heat, rampant illiteracy 
and poverty, the Delta was a cruel place for many African Americans well into the 

middle of the 20th century. The blues documented their experience better than 
any other form of cultural expression. The songs and music 
of the early Delta blues were passed down orally, in written form, and later 
preserved in field recordings made 
by traveling ethno-musicologists such as the 
father and son team of John and Alan Lomax in the early 1940s.  

In the 1920s and '30s Delta bluesmen Charley Patton, Son House, and Robert 
Johnson influenced the next generation of Mississippi 
born blues greats like Muddy 
Waters, who took the music north as they joined the mass exodus of African Americans from
 the rural south in the '40s and '50s. The acoustic sound of the Delta blues 
was amplified and electrified in Memphis and Chicago to accommodate the 
tastes of the newly urban 
population. With the growth of its recording 
industry, Chicago eventually eclipsed the Delta as the center of the blues.
The Delta area has produced the largest number of influential and important 
blues artists and, though never a major center of the 
music business, it is still 
the emotional heart of the blues for musicians and fans
