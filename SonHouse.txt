         <p>The great Son House was a six-string innovator, haunting vocalist and powerful 
	performer that set the Delta on fire during the 1920s and '30s with scorching 
	performances. He was a friend and colleague of Charley Patton, and the two 
	often traveled together. Patton introduced House to his contacts at Paramount Records. 
	House's few Paramount label 78s remain among the most highly collectible of early blues recordings, 
	but they caught the ear of Library of Congress musicologist Alan Lomax, 
	who traveled to Mississippi in 1941 to record House and friends. 
	House virtually disappeared in 1943 until he was rediscovered by a trio of blues researchers 
	in 1964 in Rochester, New York. House became part of that decade's folk-blues revival and 
	performed live into the early 1970s.
