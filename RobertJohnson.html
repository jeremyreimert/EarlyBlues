         <p>Even casual blues fans know about Robert Johnson, and thanks to the re-retelling of the story over
 	the course of decades, many know the tale of Johnson allegedly making a deal with the devil at the 
	crossroads outside of Clarksdale, Mississippi, to acquire his incredible talents. Although we'll never 
	know the truth of the matter, one fact remains,Robert Johnson is the cornerstone artist of the blues.
	As a songwriter, Johnson brought brilliant imagery and emotion to his lyrics, and many of his songs, 
	like "Love in Vain" and "Sweet Home Chicago," have become blues standards. But Johnson was also 
	a powerful singer and a skilled guitarist; throw in his early death and the aura of mystery that surrounds 
	his life, and you have a bluesman ready-made to appeal to a generation of blues-influenced rockers.
