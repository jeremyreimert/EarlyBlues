         <p>Charley Patton was the biggest star of the 1920s Delta blues circuit. 
	A charismatic performer with a flashy style, talented fretwork and flamboyant showmanship, he inspired
 	a legion of bluesmen and rockers, from Son House and Robert Johnson, to Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray 
	Vaughan. Patton lived a high-flying lifestyle full of liquor and women, and his performances at house parties, 
	juke joints and plantation dances became the stuff of legend. His loud voice, coupled with a rhythmic and 
	percussive guitar style, was both groundbreaking and designed to entertain a raucous audience. Patton began 
	recording late in his career but made up for lost time by laying down some 60 songs in less 
	than five years, including his best-selling first single, "Pony Blues."
