         <p>Born Lizzie Douglas, Memphis Minnie ran away from home at the age of 13 to play music in Memphis; 
	working for a time with Ringling Brothers Circus. Her guitar playing had a strong rhythm, coupled with 
	ragtime influences common among the Memphis musicians, and her singing was tough and swaggering. 
	Minnie moved to Chicago in the early 1930s. By this time, Minnie's music was reflecting 
	changing tastes, usually featuring a piano and string bass, and sometimes trumpet or clarinet and a drummer. 
	She became a star of the Chicago club scene, and began recording with her third husband, Little Son Joe on 
	second guitar. They were early users of amplification, and made swinging music, although it lacked the rich
	 complexity of her early recordings. In the late 40s, Memphis Minnie ran a touring vaudeville company, and she continued to
	 record after the war, playing tough electric guitar. Her efforts to keep up with trends were proving less successful, 
	however, and in the mid-50s, she and Joe retired to Memphis.
