         <p>Born Huddie Ledbetter in Louisiana, Leadbelly's music would have a profound 
	effect on both blues and folk musicians. Leadbelly's temper often landed him in trouble, however, 
	and after killing a man in Texas, he was sentenced to an extended term in the notorious state prison in Huntsville. 
	A few years after he gained an early release, he was convicted on an assault charge and sentenced to a term 
	in Louisiana's Angola Penitentiary. It was while in Angola that Leadbelly met and recorded for Library of Congress 
	musicologists John and Alan Lomax. After his release, Leadbelly continued to perform and record and 
	eventually moved to New York City. After his death in 1949, Leadbelly songs like "Midnight Special," 
	"Goodnight, Irene" and "The Rock Island Line" became hits for artists like Frank Sinatra and Johnny Cash.
